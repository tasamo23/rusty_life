# Rusty Life 🦀🌱

## Disclaimer
This repo has been created by following the [Rust/Webassembly Introductory Book](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/introduction.html). It's an awesome resource for someone like me. Check it out!👈

## Description
Hi! This is my playground for Rust, my newly learned all-time favorite programming language! 😁

I am strongly into Web development, so even though Rust was on my radar for a while, I did not consider it for my personal projects 😑

But then, I found out Rust could be compiled to WebAssembly 🤯

So, here we are...

I plan on polishing my Rust skills by developing programs like these. I always liked coding games or short little programs to learn a language.


## The Vision
If I actually 😏commit to this Game of Life project, you may see it at some point on my website (WIP).

To make that happen, I'll publish the WASM code to NPM/GitHub Packages and open up an easy API, so everyone could use the project by just importing the packages and calling one function. One should be able to customize everything about it, the obvious things being color, tick speed and starting formation. 
All features I want to implement are written down in the [Markdown TODO list](./TODO.md).
